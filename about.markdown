I came to Drake University from Olathe, KS, two years ago as an undecided major. I immediately became fascinated with programming after taking an introductory computer science course and committed to the major in my first semester. Developing creative solutions to real-world problems and studying the "how" behind life-changing technologies like Artificial Intelligence has been extremely fulfilling. **I am currently a Data Analyst Intern at Corteva Agriscience for Summer 2025**!

## My Skills
Balancing the demands of being a Division I athlete while managing three majors, a minor, and working has prepared me to take on any role. As a student-athlete, I must efficiently allocate my time between training, travel, competitions, and academic responsibilities, ensuring that I put my best foot forward in all areas. I believe that juggling these responsibilities has honed my skills in **multitasking**, **time management**, **prioritization**, and **communication**, equipping me to **thrive under pressure** and maintain high performance in the classroom and on the field.
