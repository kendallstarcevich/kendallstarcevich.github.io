# RAG Chatbot
In class, we worked through creating a chatbot using RAG and semantic search. This chatbot has an input limit of 128, which was not effective. My assignment was to implement a different model that allows for larger input but is still small enough to run on Colab. I also built the chatbot into a loop so that it will continually answer follow-up questions asked by the user and experimented with the temperature (how random the output is) to determine the value that I thought was most effective.
