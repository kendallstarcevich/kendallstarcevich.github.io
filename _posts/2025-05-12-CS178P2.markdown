# Amazon Cognito Demo
I taught myself Amazon Cognito, an AWS User Authentication and Access Control service. I created a tutorial that will walk through a step-by-step demo that creates a simple locally hosted web app with an Amazon Cognito powered login/signup.

The [tutorial link](https://hackmd.io/@IZ4dLAWgT-OlUrBGFei8ug/rkTSuXYlex#Reflection) includes an in depth explanation of Amazon Cognito's uses, pricing, and pros and cons along with the code, project summary, setup and run instructions, and a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWrWSsUD_tE).
