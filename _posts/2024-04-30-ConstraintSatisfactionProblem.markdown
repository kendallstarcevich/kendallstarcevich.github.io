# Project 5: Four-Year Academic Plan as a CSP
I implemented a CSP using the python-constraints package to create a 4-year plan that shows which courses to take in each semester as a real Drake Computer Science student. The data, including the prerequisites, when the classes are offered, meeting times, requirements, etc. were scraped from the Drake Computer Science Website. My algorithm produced a solution that satisfies all major/prerequisite constraints. [Project 5 Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A9kQ5cUUa_tC9WQyxPjqAWWvrNQI7mST?usp=sharing)
