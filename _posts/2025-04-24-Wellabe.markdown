> A project using k-means clustering to segment Wellabe customers.

# Wellabe Consultation Project

**Objective**: Optimize engagement personalization using data analysis. Considering how important personalization is to an upcoming Wellabe Rewards Program, identify how I would segment their population and why? Highlight the value to the program, how these segments impact engagement, and what my research shows.  

This project used a combination of **SQL** and **Python** in a Snowflake enviornment to form k-means clusters to segment Wellabe customers based on behavioral, demographic, and interest data.
