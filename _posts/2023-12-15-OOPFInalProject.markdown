> My final Object Oriented Programming Java project where I created a Quiz GUI. 

# OOP Quiz GUI
## <a href="https://github.com/kendallstarcevich/OOPFinalProject" target="_blank"><strong>GitHub Repo for this project</strong></a>
The README in my GitHub repo above shows how to execute this program. The program allows you to create a custom "quiz" game, where you personalize your questions and get feedback on your results.

The project contains each of the following programming elements:

- Javadoc

- Unit Testing

- Implementation of an Interface

- An example of Inheritance

When it is executed, it looks like this:
