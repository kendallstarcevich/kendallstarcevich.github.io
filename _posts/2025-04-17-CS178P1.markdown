# Airbnb Seattle Web App Project
A full-stack Flask web application for browsing and managing Seattle Airbnb listings and reviews. It integrates a MySQL database (AWS RDS) for listings/reviews and DynamoDB for user authentication. Users can sign up, log in, post/delete reviews, and browse listings by price, room type, and neighborhood. Deployed on AWS EC2.

The [Github Repo](https://github.com/kendallstarcevich/CS178Project1) includes the code, project summary, setup and run instructions, and a [demo video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYj85HC9niE).
