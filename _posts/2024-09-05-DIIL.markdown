> My experience with Drake Insurance Innovation Lab Internship.

# Drake Insurance Innovation Lab Internship
I am excited to get started this fall with a new internship through the University:

• As the group’s **Data Analyst**, set to develop strategic solutions for **Wellabe's** new
rewards program launch, delivering recommendations to senior executives.

• Scheduled for discussions with leaders from **Global Insurance Accelerator** and
**BrokerTech Ventures** on mentorship and accelerator processes.

• Will attend regulatory and investment strategy seminars with Iowa Insurance
Commissioner and venture capitalists.

• Preparing to analyze innovation practices with ten carriers and brokers, leading to an
**additional consulting project next spring**.
