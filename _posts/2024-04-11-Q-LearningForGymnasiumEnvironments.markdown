# Project 4: Q-LEarning for Gymnasium Environments
I completed a lab in class to get a Q-Learning algorithm working in the Gymnasium Frozen Lake Environment. For this project, I had to implement it in another Gymnasium environment and evaluate how well my Q-Learning agent performed - I chose Taxi. To test its success, I also compared it with an agent that had a randomized algorithm. [Project 4 Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xPIFWcNdlLDPlFGZiuRz65zhotITwcyM?usp=sharing)
