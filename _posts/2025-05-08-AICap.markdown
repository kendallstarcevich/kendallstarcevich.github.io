# AI Capstone Secure HIPAA Compliant AI Chatbot (HIPAAi)
My Capstone Group developed a secure, role-based AI chatbot tailored for the health insurance industry to theoretically ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations. The chatbot uses a custom dataset and restricts information access based on user roles through a secure login system. We implemented early fine-tuning, role-specific permissions, and began integrating data privacy features. Built with LangChain and GPT-4, the project aims to offer a trusted conversational interface for sensitive insurance queries.
